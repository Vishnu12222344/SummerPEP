In Java, concurrency and parallelism are related but distinct concepts concerning how multiple tasks are handled within a program.
Concurrency:
Dealing with multiple tasks at the same time:
Concurrency enables a program to manage and make progress on multiple tasks, even if they are not strictly executing simultaneously.

Parallelism:
Simultaneous execution of tasks:
Parallelism involves the actual simultaneous execution of multiple tasks or sub-tasks on multiple processing units (e.g., multiple CPU cores).

ThreadPool:

A thread pool in Java is a collection of pre-initialized and managed worker threads available to execute tasks. Instead of creating a new thread for every task, which can be resource-intensive and lead to performance overhead, a thread pool reuses existing threads, improving efficiency and resource utilization. 

Executors Class:
Provides convenient factory methods to create common types of thread pools, such as:
FixedThreadPool: Maintains a fixed number of threads.
 ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
 
CachedThreadPool: Creates new threads as needed but reuses idle ones.
 ExecutorService CachedPool = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
 
ScheduledThreadPool: Used for scheduling tasks to be executed at a later time or at a fixed rate.

SingleThreadExecutor: Uses a single worker thread to execute tasks sequentially.
