âœ… Framework in Java
A Framework is a pre-written reusable set of libraries and tools that provides a structured environment and standard practices to develop applications efficiently. It acts as a foundation upon which software developers can build programs for a specific platform.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features of a Framework (in Java):
Code Reusability:
Predefined libraries and components can be reused across projects, reducing development time.

Inversion of Control (IoC):
The framework controls the flow of the program, not the developer. Common in frameworks like Spring.

Modularity:
Large applications can be broken into modules, making them easier to manage and test.

Security:
Built-in security features like authentication, authorization, and data validation.

Scalability:
Frameworks allow applications to grow in size and complexity easily.

Ease of Testing:
Support for unit and integration testing, often with built-in testing tools.

Integration:
Easy integration with databases (like MySQL, Oracle), web servers (like Tomcat), and other tools.

MVC Support (Model-View-Controller):
Most Java frameworks support the MVC design pattern, separating business logic, UI, and data.

ðŸ’¡ Popular Java Frameworks:

Framework	Used For	Key Highlight
Spring	Enterprise apps	Dependency Injection, REST APIs
Hibernate	ORM (Object Relational Mapping)	Maps Java objects to database
Struts	Web apps	Follows MVC architecture
JSF (JavaServer Faces)	Web UI	UI component-based framework
